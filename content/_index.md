# Hello, there!

Welcome to my home page ^_^

## A little about me:

I'm lucky enough to have a great partner and a goofy puppy.

My job is to write code for video games.

I also enjoy writing code for video games in my free time. ;)

My [blog](/blog) records my [thoughts](/blog) about and [tips](/blog) for game development.
