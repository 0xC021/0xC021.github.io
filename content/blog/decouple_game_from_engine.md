Choosing a game engine feels like such a binding choice. You're an Unreal developer, or a Unity developer, or a Godot developer, etc. Once you've invested the time and money into learning the capabilities, workflows, and quirks of your engine, it's hard to imagine a situation where you would consider leaving that ecosystem.

Unfortunately, the year is 2023 and we live in a world where game engines do not always meet the needs of their users. Perhaps the owning company reveals that they are perfectly willing to change the terms of service of their engine in radical ways, even retroactively. Maybe you disagree with the engine adding shiny new features while the existing features that you depend on are neglected.

Hitching your wagon to a specific game engine is suddenly a scary proposition. The cost of switching engines is monumental, even for an indie developer.

### how can reduce the cost of switching engines?
