C++ too complicated
* minimal language
* flexible error handling
* C semantics in a modern language

Fix annoyances with C
* no macros
* no null pointers!
* Const by default
* Adds friction where necessary
* performance-focused

Language innovations
* comptime
* compile time type info

Compare to other languages
* rust
* C#?

Around the language improvements
* tooling
* standard library is readable and useful in freestanding
* build system is zig code

Mention some downsides
* not 1.0 yet
* conditional compilation

Can it work with my existing code?
* C ABI / easy interop
* Runs anywhere
* cross-compiling
* builtin c compiler
